134. Gas Station
Medium
There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

Example 1:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:

Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

Constraints:

gas.length == n
cost.length == n
1 <= n <= 105
0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 104

1345. 跳跃游戏 IV
给你一个整数数组 arr ，你一开始在数组的第一个元素处（下标为 0）。

每一步，你可以从下标 i 跳到下标：

i + 1 满足：i + 1 < arr.length
i - 1 满足：i - 1 >= 0
j 满足：arr[i] == arr[j] 且 i != j
请你返回到达数组最后一个元素的下标处所需的 最少操作次数 。

注意：任何时候你都不能跳到数组外面。

示例 1：

输入：arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]
输出：3
解释：那你需要跳跃 3 次，下标依次为 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9 。下标 9 为数组的最后一个元素的下标。
示例 2：

输入：arr = [7]
输出：0
解释：一开始就在最后一个元素处，所以你不需要跳跃。
示例 3：

输入：arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]
输出：1
解释：你可以直接从下标 0 处跳到下标 7 处，也就是数组的最后一个元素处。
示例 4：

输入：arr = [6,1,9]
输出：2
示例 5：

输入：arr = [11,22,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,22,13]
输出：3

提示：

1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4
-10^8 <= arr[i] <= 10^8
