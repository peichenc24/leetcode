31. Next Permutation
Medium
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are considered permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]

744. 寻找比目标字母大的最小字母
给你一个排序后的字符列表 letters ，列表中只包含小写英文字母。另给出一个目标字母 target，请你寻找在这一有序列表里比目标字母大的最小字母。

在比较时，字母是依序循环出现的。举个例子：

如果目标字母 target = 'z' 并且字符列表为 letters = ['a', 'b']，则答案返回 'a'

示例 1：

输入: letters = ["c", "f", "j"]，target = "a"
输出: "c"
示例 2:

输入: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
输出: "f"
示例 3:

输入: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "d"
输出: "f"
