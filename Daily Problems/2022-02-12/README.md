127. Word Ladder
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

Constraints:

1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.

1020. 飞地的数量
给你一个大小为 m x n 的二进制矩阵 grid ，其中 0 表示一个海洋单元格、1 表示一个陆地单元格。
一次 移动 是指从一个陆地单元格走到另一个相邻（上、下、左、右）的陆地单元格或跨过 grid 的边界。

返回网格中 无法 在任意次数的移动中离开网格边界的陆地单元格的数量。

示例 1：

输入：grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
输出：3
解释：有三个 1 被 0 包围。一个 1 没有被包围，因为它在边界上。
示例 2：

输入：grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
输出：0
解释：所有 1 都在边界上或可以到达边界。

提示：

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 500
grid[i][j] 的值为 0 或 1
