81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
Medium
There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with distinct values).

Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].

Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
-104 <= target <= 104
 

Follow up: This problem is similar to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

693. 交替位二进制数
给定一个正整数，检查它的二进制表示是否总是 0、1 交替出现：换句话说，就是二进制表示中相邻两位的数字永不相同。

示例 1：

输入：n = 5
输出：true
解释：5 的二进制表示是：101
示例 2：

输入：n = 7
输出：false
解释：7 的二进制表示是：111.
示例 3：

输入：n = 11
输出：false
解释：11 的二进制表示是：1011.
